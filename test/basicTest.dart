The goal of Dart is 'ultimately to replace JavaScript as the lingua franca of web development on the open web platform'. Until then, in order to run in mainstream browsers, Dart relies on a source-to-source compiler to JavaScript. To attempt performance gains, Google engineers have evolved Dart as well as extended JavaScript, since 'pursuing either strategy in isolation [would be] likely to fail.' However, Dart has had mixed reception and the Dart initiative has been criticized by industry leaders for fragmenting the web, in much the same way as VBScript. According to the project site, Dart was 'designed to be easy to write development tools for, well-suited to modern app development, and capable of high-performance implementations.'");
